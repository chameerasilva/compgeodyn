## Goal and Objectives

This course aims to enable students to understand the basics of the finite element method (FEM), 
a versatile numerical method for solving partial differential equations.

After taking this course, students will be able
to use or modify as necessary the existing community finite element codes (e.g., [CIG codes](https://geodynamics.org/resources/notebooks)) for their geophysical research.

To achieve the goal, we will

1.  review the fundamental governing equations in continuum mechanics,

2.  have under-the-hood understanding of finite element method,

3.  gain hands-on experience with common procedure and useful practices
    in computational research,

4.  use one of the open-source FEM codes, possibly after modifications,
    for their term project.

### Online resources

-   The web sites listed below will help you get familiar with 
the command line-based work environment and other useful tools 
for computational research.

    -   How to work on a Linux(-like) system especially when you are new
        to it:\
        <https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/tutorials/>;\
        search for tutorials with keywords "LPIC-1" and "exam 1"

    -   Lessons on BASH, Python and Git by Software Carpentry:\
        <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>

    -   Programming languages (C, Python, etc) and parallel computing
        (OpenMP, MPI, GPU etc)\
        <https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/topics>

## Term projects

-   Students carry out a reasonably small but non-trivial project
    relevant to the course's goal and objectives.

-   They should use GitHub to manage their projects and products as
    sharable and reusable resources.

-   A project topic will be decided individually based on students' interests and
    needs.

-   Possible topics:

    -   Consider in a global-scale mantle convection model the effects
        of centrifugal acceleration in addition to the typical
        geocentric gravity

    -   Reproduce and possibly improve a published work on computational
        methods.

    -   Parallelize an existing code with a directive-based approach
        such as OpenMP and OpenACC and assess the performance
        improvement

    -   Introduce recent advances in physics-informed neural networks
        (PINNs)
